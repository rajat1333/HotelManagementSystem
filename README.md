Use Case:

Implement an end2end Hotel booking application for a specific chain of hotels with locations around the world (Web interface or Mobile app interface with supporting Backend APIs), that integrates Hotel rewards account with reservations for each Hotel customer. (e.g. see Marriott.com or ihg.com )

The emphasis here is on team collaboration, so the points awarded will be based on individual contributions to the team and how the team performed overall.  

Components
APIs - input and output of API should be in JSON and should include error handling and validation of inputs
APIs can be demonstrated using a basic Web/mobile UI or through Postman
UI will be used by Customers and Hotel employees
APIs should support following functionality:
Manage your Hotel rewards account
Search for Hotels
Book one or more rooms for stay up to 1 week
Options may be selected for each room for one or more amenities:
Daily Continental Breakfast
Access to fitness room
Access to Swimming Pool/Jacuzzi
Daily Parking
All meals included (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
Room rates based on Room types and number of guests e.g. Double rooms, Suites, Singe room ( up to guests)
Use dynamic pricing - based on weekdays/weekends/holidays
Seasonal - peak season such as Summer/Christmas Holiday season
Customer Loyalty
Change/Cancel reservations
Enrolling as a new customer
Deploy API to AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer (or another cloud provider)
Develop a Web or mobile UI that will make use of the APIs
Create your own database with mock data
Requirements:

Each member must own at least one of the components in the Team project.
Keep a Project Journal on GitHub in markdown format to include:
Weekly Scrum Report (i.e. weekly version of daily scrum) which answers the three daily stand-up questions:
What tasks did I work on / complete?
What am I planning to work on next?
What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
Select one of the XP Core Values and keep a journal of how the team kept these values throughout the project.  Report this in your Project Journal with the weekly Scrum Report submissions:
Communication
Simplicity
Feedback
Courage
Respect
Maintain Weekly Scrum Task Board (in GitHub as a Project Board)
Update the Story on your Task Board
Keep track of remaining effort and progress on a Team Task Board.
Use (and modify) the Google Task Sheet Template at:

Track your Team's Burndown Chart in this Sheet.
Maintain the project in an assigned Team GitHub Repo.
Maintain a Scrum Task Board (using GitHub Project Board)
Create UI Wireframes
Create UI wireframes for each of the screen in your team’s solution
(this can be done by hand or electronically with a tool like “Pencil”)
Create an Overall Architecture Diagram showing:
Software Components and their Public Interfaces
The Dependencies between Components
The Relative Relationship of how these components are Deployed
Recommendation:  Use UML Deployment/Component Diagram Notation.

Maintain a README markdown file in the Team's GitHub Repo.
Include all Diagrams, Design decisions and the overall Feature Set of the project
Perform Project Demo
Give a demo of your teams working prototype on "Demo Day"
Grading:
Teams will be be graded with a Team Score during Demo Day.
100 points
Individual deductions will be made to the Team Score based on contributions to be judged by:
Completeness and Functioning Demo of your Component (as noted on Demo Day)
Frequency and Quality of commits to the project Github. 
As such, it is expected that all contributions must be visible via Github.  See the following guidelines for how GitHub counts contributions:  https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
Rubric:

Architecture/Design: 10%

Implementation of requirements (working software): 70%

Agile Scrum Process  (includes Weekly commits and submitting Sprint artifacts, XP values): 20%

Github insights - expectation is that every member has similar amount of contributions to code-lesser contributions will result in individual deductions

Submission (One per Team): -include this information in the Readme section of the repo:
Your Team Name
The names of each team member
A summary of areas of contributions (for each team member)
Link to your team's GitHub Repo
Link to your team's Project Board (on GitHub)
Link to your team's Project Journal (on GitHub)
Link to your team's Google Sprint Task Sheet
